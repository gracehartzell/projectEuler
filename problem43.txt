The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2
d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3
d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5
d5d6d7=357 is divisible by 7
d6d7d8=572 is divisible by 11
d7d8d9=728 is divisible by 13
d8d9d10=289 is divisible by 17
Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

Knowns from problem:
  Substrings are divisible by prime numbers in ascending order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17)
  This is a 10-digit 0 to 9 pandigital with no redundant digits and contains 0 (i.e. cannot use the same number twice within string) (shout      out to Sudoku)
  The total number of possible numbers is 3,265,920 (9 * 9!)
  To make it a little more confusing, the digits are labeled from 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9. I used a table when writing the problem out        and recreated it below:
